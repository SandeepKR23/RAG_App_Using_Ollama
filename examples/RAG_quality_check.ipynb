       "**Understanding Preorders**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Definition:** A preorder (often simplified as just \"pre-order\") on a set *S* is a structure that satisfies the following properties:\n",
       "    1. **Non-negativity:** For any elements *a*, *b* in *S*, if  *a ≤ b*, then there's a specific way to compare these elements (often indicated by \"<=\"). \n",
       "    2. **Transitivity:** If *a ≤ b* and *b ≤ c*, then *a ≤ c*.\n",
       "    3. **Reflexivity:** For each element in *S*, it has some relation with itself, but this can't always be the same for every other element (this is where the \"mostly directional\" part comes into play). \n",
       "\n",
       "**Think of Preorders as a Special Case of Categories** \n",
       "\n",
       "* **Preorders and Categories:** A preorder is essentially a *specialized* category. Imagine categories as more abstract, complex structures. A preorder is like a simpler version where you have to consider only the \"ordering\" between elements.  \n",
       "    \n",
       "**Key Concepts**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Morphisms:** A morphism (sometimes called a \"function\" in this context) represents an ordering relation. \n",
       "   * **Example:** If *a ≤ b*, then there's a special mapping or function from *S* to itself, where *a* gets mapped to *b*. The key is that the map should satisfy these properties (the pre-order constraints).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Hom-sets and Composition:**  Think about hom-sets as \"maps\" between objects in our preorder category:\n",
       "   * **Definition:** A hom-set of two elements *a* and *b* is simply a set that contains all the possible mappings from *a* to *b*.  For example, if we have an ordering (pre-order), then the hom-set C(a, b) would contain the specific mapping (function) between *a* and *b*. \n",
       "   * **Composition:** The composition of morphisms is like \"mapping\" one function into another based on this order. For example, we can say:  If a is less than or equal to b, then map a to b (it doesn't have to be the same in every case).  \n",

       "\n",
       "**What is a Nyström Approximation?**\n",
       "\n",
       "In machine learning, especially with neural networks (like those used in this paper), the goal is often to simplify complex calculations and reduce their computational burden. The Nyström Approximation helps with this by approximating a high-dimensional matrix with a low-dimensional one. \n",
       "\n",
       "**How it Works**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Original Matrix:** Imagine you have a large matrix, *C*, that represents the \"correlation\" of some input features (Xi). This is where the activation patterns in your neural network reside.\n",
       "2. **Low-Rank Approximation:**  The Nyström Approximation attempts to represent this complex *C* with a much simpler one, called *W*. Think of *W* as a smaller \"representative matrix.\" It's often designed so that its rank (number of linearly independent columns) is less than the original matrix. \n",
       "3. **\"Nyström Approximation Error\":** The difference between the original *C* and your simplified *W* is called the approximation error. This error is controlled by the choice of *W*.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why It's Useful**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Efficiency:** Replacing a complex *C* with a simpler *W* (the Nyström Approximation) drastically reduces computation when using matrix operations like:\n",
       "    * Finding the correlation between features\n",
       "    * Performing computations on the activation patterns in your neural network. \n",
       "* **Generalization:**  It's not just about speed; this method helps achieve better generalization, meaning the model can perform well on unseen examples, even though it simplified some of the complexity.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Connection to the Text You Provided**\n",
       "\n",
       "In the text you shared, they are applying a Nyström approximation specifically to compress matrix *C*. The key point is that:\n",
       "\n",
       "* **They use a lower-rank representation:**  By choosing *WUSk* for WU and *WD*, they ensure that the overall computational complexity of finding correlations or performing computations is reduced. \n",
       "* **It's related to activation correlation matrices:** Their approximation relies on the idea of capturing essential information from the input features (represented by Xi) using a smaller matrix, thereby reducing computation.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In Essence**\n",
       "\n",
       "The Nyström Approximation simplifies complex calculations within neural networks by representing them with lower-rank approximations. It's a powerful technique for improving efficiency and generalization! \n",
